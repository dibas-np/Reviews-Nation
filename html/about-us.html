                <p>In this 21st century of technology, entertainment is the important part of human life.
                Watching movies/series and chilling in home or visiting the theatre itself has become
                the hobby of majority of people. People are always looking for something to watch in YouTube or
                Netflix or any other platforms. People including myself can't figure out which movie to watch or
                unsure about to watch certain movie or not. When the new movies and series is released some people
                don't want to rush and wait for the reviews of other people. That is where the idea of this site came
                from. Reviews Nation provides the reviews of newly released movies or series. In case of movies, reviews
                can be found within one day of the release and for series reviews is given after certain episodes. We here
                at Reviews Nation are always looking for to improve the site for the better experience of the users. Our
                aim is to be genuine movie critics website. We want people to trust our reviews so we are always working
                hard on that. We don't take any money from film makers to give good reviews to their movies.
